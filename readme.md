# Modeling Grocery Prices In Seven Countries  Using Bayesian Statistics
## Motivation
One of the advantages of being a Minerva Student is the opportunity to have quick access to fellow students from all around the world. This gives us a chance to broaden our horizons and apply our knowledge in various contexts and using a great variety of data. 

My model would help answer questions like: 
- To what extent do grocery prices vary by country and store brand? 
- Are grocery prices and the geographical distribution correlated with other cost-of-living measures?
I attempt to address these questions by utilizing Bayesian Statistics and PyStan functionality available in Python. Model setup, as well as conclusions, are described below.
